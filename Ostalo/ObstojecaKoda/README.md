# IPAD

This project is a fork of two repositories:
- the original [RITnet repository](https://github.com/AayushKrChaudhary/RITnet) and
- the original [LeGR repository](https://github.com/enyac-group/LeGR).

The code contained in here was adapted and further developed for the experiments described in the paper "IPAD: Iterative Pruning with Activation Deviation for Sclera Biometrics". For information regarding the original projects and their setup and usage see the original repositories' pages.

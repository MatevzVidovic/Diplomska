                "host": "localhost",
                // "port": 5678, // for diplomska
                "port": 8765 // for bashpy sysrun

                // I have run.py which (sequentially) runs many instances of main.py.
                // In run.py, I open debugpy remote debugging on port 5678.
                // (always when I say this, I mean: inside try catch, where we warn and ignore the exception if catch.)
                // In main.py, I open remote debug on 5678 - it fails and gets caught, because 5678 already open.
                // But this is no problem - when remote debugging in run.py, when you run Popen with a python process,
                // the debugging nicely transfers into the subprocess (doesn't work if Popen runs a bash file which runs python processes tho).
                // But for some reason, this works for like 5 subprocesses, and then I start getting a weird error.
                // And on subsequent runs, this problem starts with the first subprocess already. So yeah, there are problems.

                // So I made a change:
                // run.py now has debug on port 8765.
                // When I run this setup, I first need to start (in VScode) remote debug attach for 8765, 
                // and then change the launch.json to using port 5678, and then run it again for each subprocess that starts.

                // Then I also tried: disable debugging for run.py and just have it for main.py. But again, we need to do VScode attach for each subprocess.

                // So I disabled debugging for run.py, and just have it for main.py. And this works great, because we go into subprocesses anyway.
                // Obvious in hindsight.

                // Additionally:
                // - I think if you run remote debug, and you change launch.json in the meanwhile, you get a "Client not authenticated" VScode error.
                // But I'm really not sure.
                // - I think a source of the first config above failing (despite the try-catch) might have something to do with multiprocessing in dataloaders?
                // Again, I have no idea.

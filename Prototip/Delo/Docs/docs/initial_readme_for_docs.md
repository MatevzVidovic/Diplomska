This is an editing of gpt4 answers on how to set this up both locally and on github pages.

# 1
Write your documentation in separate Markdown files. Organize these files into a directory structure that makes sense for your project, for example:

/docs
  - introduction.md
  - installation.md
  - usage.md
  - faq.md


# 2
Docsify is a tool that dynamically generates a documentation website from your Markdown files. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

    Install Docsify: First, install Docsify globally via npm:

npm install -g docsify-cli

    Initialize Docsify in your repository: Navigate to the root of your local repository and run:

docsify init ./docs

This will create an index.html, a .nojekyll file to prevent GitHub Pages from using Jekyll, and a README.md in the docs folder.

    index.html: The entry point of the site.
    README.md: The main content file, which acts as the homepage.
    .nojekyll: Prevents GitHub Pages from ignoring files that begin with an underscore.

Configure the Sidebar and Navigation

    Create a _sidebar.md: In your docs folder, create a _sidebar.md file to define the structure of your documentation sidebar. Example:

- [Home](/)
- [Introduction](introduction.md)
- [Installation](installation.md)
- [Usage](usage.md)
- [FAQ](faq.md)

    Configure Docsify: Modify the index.html to include the sidebar:

<script>
  window.$docsify = {
    loadSidebar: true,
    ...
  }
</script>



Docsify is highly customizable. You can modify the index.html to change settings, add themes, or enable features like full-text search, emoji support, and more. For example, to enable the search plugin, you can add the following script tag to your index.html:

<script>
    window.$docsify = {
        search: 'auto', // enables the search plugin
    }
</script>
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/lib/plugins/search.min.js"></script>


To expand your documentation, simply add more Markdown files to the docs directory. You can link these files in a _sidebar.md for navigation:

- [Home](/)
- [Guide](guide.md)




# 4
Serve Your Documentation Locally

To view your documentation site locally, navigate to the docs directory and start the local server:

docsify serve docs


# 5
 Publish Your Documentation

    Push Changes to GitHub: Commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository.
    Enable GitHub Pages: Go to the repository settings on GitHub, find the GitHub Pages section, and set the source to the master branch and /docs folder.

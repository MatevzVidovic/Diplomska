# The script is meant for automatic storing of outputs of programs.

# This script creates bash_results/curr/ and bash_results/older
# It moves what is in curr into older.
# Then it writes into curr the copy of the current .sh file,
# and the time at the start of it's execution.

# It then enables you to save the output of your commands by simply pasting this line:
# # [command]    2>&1 | tee "${rfn}/curr/${obn}_${cbi}_${cn}.txt"; cn=$((cn + 1))
# This will then write to a file in bash_results/curr, while also printing to stdout.

# For this, please do not use:
# command_num=0
# obn=${output_basic_name}
# rfn=${results_folder_name}
# cbi=${curr_bash_ix}
# cn=${command_num}

# source z_bash_saver.sh

# Writing to a file and a terminal:
# [command]    2>&1 | tee "${rfn}/curr/${obn}_${cbi}_${cn}.txt"; cn=$((cn + 1))
# Explanation:
# 2>&1 - redirect stderr to stdout 
# | - pipe the output to the next command
# tee - read from stdin and write to stdout and files (stdin is here the output of the previous command)


# This didn't work so far:
# {
# We want another file, which will collect all errors from all the commands.
# So we can see all the errors that happened fast. To locate them after, we just ctrl+f them in the actual output files.
# We do this like so:

# Saving std error to a file while we are also doing the above saving of stdout and stderr:
# 2>> "${rfn}/curr/stderr_log_{cbi}.txt" 2>&1 | tee "${rfn}/curr/${obn}_${cbi}_${cn}.txt"; cn=$((cn + 1))
# The first part redirects stderr to this file (>> appends, > overwrites)
# So somehow 2 goes both to the file and to 1. Don't ask me how exactly this works.

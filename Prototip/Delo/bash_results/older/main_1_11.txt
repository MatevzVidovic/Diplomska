0 trainings have been done without error stopping.
                        Best k models are kept. (possibly (k+1) models are kept if one of the worse models is the last model we have).
                        Enter s to save the model and re-ask for input.
                        Enter g to show the graph of the model and re-ask for input.
                        Enter r to trigger show_results() and re-ask for input.
                        Enter a number to reset in how many trainings we ask you this again, and re-ask for input.
                        Enter p to prune anyways (in production code, that is commented out, so the program will simply stop).
                        Press Enter to continue training.
                        Enter any other key to stop.

I have:

x_out.txt for the current out file.
y_run_me.sbatch for the script that runs on FRIDA

And then i have the shell scripts.

z_ are the ones I actually run.

I have z_general.sh
Here, write anything the moment requires.
It should be gitignored so this doesn't keep making needles changes.

z_0 - z_9 are levels of calling.
z_0 don't saurce anything.
z_1 source some from z_0. And so on.

zz_ are the old scripts.
